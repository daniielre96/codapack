  "body": "# CoDaPack\r\n\r\nHistorically CoDaPack 3D was intended to be a package of Compositional \r\nData with an easy and intuitive way of use. For this reason from the \r\nbeginning it has been associated with Excel, software known and used \r\nfor many people. However, over the years different versions of Excel \r\nand Windows have been appeared and CoDaPack has had to be adapted to \r\nthese new versions due to some incompatibilities.\r\n\r\nFor this reason and also because of CoDaPack only worked with Excel under \r\nwindows; the Girona Compositional Data Group decided to implement a new \r\nsoftware with at least the same capabilities and the same profile of users \r\nbut independent of any other software.\r\n\r\nThe new CoDaPack has three different areas: the variables area, the data \r\narea and the results area which has a textual output window and independent \r\ngraphical output. Also it is expected to work at least under Unix, Window \r\nand MacOS operating systems.\r\n\r\n# CoDaPack: start developing\r\n\r\nClone codapack (and optionally codapack-updater)\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\ngit clone http://github.com/mcomas/codapack.git\r\ngit clone http://github.com/mcomas/codapack-updater.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nDownload external libraries.\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\ncurl mcomas.net/codapack/codapack-lib.zip > codapack-lib.zip\r\n```\r\n\r\nand decompress them into `codapack/libs` folder\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\nunzip codapack-lib.zip -d codapack/lib/\r\n```\r\n",
